## Current focus
Release `0.1.98` is published, deployed through HACS, restarted, and live-validated in Home Assistant. Older release-plan/UI-map history is intentionally cleared from this status document.

## Active bugs
- ZNE-578 — native managed-row gear beside the pencil is not supported by current Home Assistant frontend. Closest supported path is implemented and live-validated: managed child-device `configuration_url` opens the Home Assistant device-detail cog/deep-link into the `ZNE Managed Devices` editor. Exact native-row placement requires upstream HA frontend work if still required.
- ZNE-579 — Add service wrongly aborted as `already_configured`. Fixed and live-validated; unique ids are now scoped to the submitted service/system name.
- ZNE-580 — multiple services looked like duplicated generic controllers. Fixed and live-validated; Summer/Winter plan controller rows and managed-device scoping are separated.
- ZNE-581 — no obvious per-service Configure service action. Released in `0.1.98`; Home Assistant's native per-service row actions are visible on the live Zero Net Export integration detail page.
- ZNE-582 — no obvious per-service Add Managed Devices action. Released in `0.1.98`; Home Assistant's native per-service row actions and top-level Add Managed Devices action are visible on the live Zero Net Export integration detail page.

## Active feature scope
- ZNE-FR-001 — managed-device settings should reopen first-provisioned settings. Supported device-detail cog/deep-link path is live-validated; exact native-row gear remains upstream-blocked.
- ZNE-FR-002 — controller identity must be plan-specific. Live-validated fixed.
- ZNE-FR-003 — controller config must be isolated per plan. Tracked; needs validation through the per-service Configure service flow.
- ZNE-FR-004 — managed devices must be isolated per plan. Live-validated fixed for Winter/Summer managed-device scoping.
- ZNE-FR-005 — controller runtime/brain state must be isolated per plan. Tracked pending validation.
- ZNE-FR-006 — multi-plan validation evidence. Live-validated for controller identity and managed-device assignment.

## Validation evidence
- ZNE-578: focused tests passed and live Home Assistant proof captured for the supported device-detail cog/deep-link path.
- ZNE-579: focused config-flow tests passed; live Home Assistant add-service validation succeeded without `already_configured` and cleanup was completed.
- ZNE-580: focused multi-entry tests passed; live Home Assistant screenshots and registry evidence show separate Summer/Winter rows with Coffee machine scoped to Winter only.
- ZNE-581/ZNE-582: repo implementation committed as `32796d8 Add per-service HA entry actions`; release validation passed with `python3 -m py_compile custom_components/zero_net_export/config_flow.py`, `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` (599 tests OK), HACS install fingerprint match, Home Assistant restart, entity-state checks, logs scan, and live browser screenshot.
- Release `0.1.98`: GitHub release `v0.1.98` published from commit `4140c1d930fcc6370ec99c108b424042574a0c42`; HACS installed `v0.1.98`; Home Assistant restarted and reported `sensor.zero_net_export_installed_version = 0.1.98`, `sensor.zero_net_export_previous_installed_version = 0.1.97`, and `update.zero_net_export_update` installed/latest `v0.1.98`.
- Release validation record: `validation/0.1.98-release-validation.md`.
- Browser evidence: `bug-evidence/zne-0.1.98-live-integrations.png`.

## Blockers / approvals
- No release blocker remains for `0.1.98`.
- Exact native managed-row gear placement for ZNE-578 requires an upstream Home Assistant frontend feature request/PR if Riley still wants that exact UI location.
- Runtime control remains blocked in the validation Home Assistant instance until required source roles are configured; this is expected and not a release-install failure.

## Next best action
Monitor for user-reported issues from `0.1.98`. If Riley still wants exact native managed-row gear placement, decide whether to open an upstream Home Assistant frontend feature request/PR; otherwise keep the supported device-detail cog/deep-link path as the accepted resolution.
